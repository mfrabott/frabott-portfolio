<!-- Bio/about me section -->

            <h2 class="section-heading">About</h2>
            
            <p>After enjoying the past ten years working as a paralegal, I recently decided to embark on a new challenge in the world of web development. While my responsibilities and skillset in that role continued to expand, I realized that I wanted to spend more time focusing on the aspects of my job that I enjoyed and excelled at the most - working through technical and logic questions and expanding on opportunities to be more creative.</p>
            <br>
            <br>
            <p>Dealing primarily with oil and gas matters, I have assisted hundreds of landowners in the negotiation of comprehensive leases and easement agreements and helped develop and implement winning strategies in complex litigation in state, federal, and appellate courts. Most recently, I oversaw the management of a putative class-action trespass case with over 1,000 members and encompassing roughly 30,000 acres of affected land.</p> 
            <br>
            <br>            
            <p>I look forward to bringing my attention to detail, eagerness to learn, and ability to balance independent work and collaboration to a new environment where I can both push myself and contribute to the development of innovative and useful code. </p>
            <br>
            <br>
            <p>I am currently enrolled in the Ohio State University/2U, Inc. Full-Stack Bootcamp, which I will complete in January 2023. I earned a B.A. in Sociology and Criminology from The Ohio State University in 2011 and a Paralegal Certificate from Capital University Law School in 2014.</p>
            <br>
            <br>
            <p>Reach out below - I look forward to discussing how we can build something together!</p>
