# frabott-portfolio

## Overview

This challenge was to create a personal portfolio website including certain specified criteria(below). While I do not have much to display at this point, over time I will be able to add to this webpage to demonstrate my abilities to potential employers. 

## User Story

    AS AN employer
    I WANT to view a potential employee's deployed portfolio of work samples
    SO THAT I can review samples of their work and assess whether they're a good candidate for an open position

## Acceptance Criteria

    GIVEN I need to sample a potential employee's previous work
    WHEN I load their portfolio
    THEN I am presented with the developer's name, a recent photo or avatar, and links to sections about them, their work, and how to contact them
    WHEN I click one of the links in the navigation
    THEN the UI scrolls to the corresponding section
    WHEN I click on the link to the section about their work
    THEN the UI scrolls to a section with titled images of the developer's applications
    WHEN I am presented with the developer's first application
    THEN that application's image should be larger in size than the others
    WHEN I click on the images of the applications
    THEN I am taken to that deployed application
    WHEN I resize the page or view the site on various screens and devices
    THEN I am presented with a responsive layout that adapts to my viewport

## Challenge Accomplishments

In creating this portfolio, some of the highlights of new skills and concepts I learned and/or applied to this challenge include: 

	Creating my first from-scratch webpage(!);
    Learning about ‘at rules’;
    Using media queries to optimize my portfolio webpage for desktop and mobile screens;
    Learning how to manipulate gradients;
    Creating and using CSS variables;
    Learning about and implementing CSS animation;
    Creating ‘mailto’ and ‘tel’ links to open email client and phone apps, respectively;
    Using pseudo-classes;
    Building my comfort level with flexbox concepts.


## Aditional Thoughts

While I am happy enough with the current version of this portfolio, I will continue to make adjustments for personal use, ultimately working on a more minimalistic design. 
Some of the elements create a busier design than I would ultimately like to end up with, but for the purpose of this challenge (and stage in learning) I wanted to explore and implement new concepts that I may refer back to in the future. 


### Text gradient template

I used the following source code as a foundation for the title text animation:
